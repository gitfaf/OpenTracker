# Open BitTorrent-tracker

Right now the tracker is public-only. Basically, anyone can create a torrent and add the public announce url, and it will get registered with the tracker. A private tracker ability, like TBdev, is in the making at the moment.

### To-do:
	- private tracker ability
	- users
	- forums
	- torrent browsing
	- torrent upload
